# Fraud Detection App
### A simple web application built with Flask to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on user-provided input data. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model, logs all transactions to a CSV file, and provides a basic user interface for input and result display.

### Features
* Input Form: Enter transaction details (e.g., distances, purchase ratio, binary flags).
* Prediction: Uses a pre-trained model (fraud_model.pkl) to classify transactions as "Fraudulent" or "Legitimate".
* Transaction Logging: Saves all inputs and results to transaction_log.csv with timestamps.
* Simple UI: Basic styling with a form and result page, including a "Return to Form" link.
